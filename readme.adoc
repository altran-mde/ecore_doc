Generates https://asciidoctor.org/[AsciiDoctor] files to document Ecore metamodels, similar to https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/javadoc/javadoc.htm[JavaDoc].
AsciiDoctor can be rendered as HTML, PDF, or Eclipse Help.
EcoreDoc can be used as https://maven.apache.org/[Maven] Plugin, standalone command-line tool, or as Java API.

For more details, please refer to the <<doc/ecoredoc-userguide.adoc#, EcoreDoc User Guide>>.

However, the GitLab rendering misses important parts,
so you might want to look at the link:doc/ecoredoc-userguide.pdf[PDF version] with different rendering issues,
or clone the repository and use the link:doc/ecoredoc-userguide.html[official rendering].
