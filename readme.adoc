Generates https://asciidoctor.org/[AsciiDoctor] files to document Ecore metamodels, similar to https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/javadoc/javadoc.htm[JavaDoc].
AsciiDoctor can be rendered as HTML, PDF, or Eclipse Help.
EcoreDoc can be used as Maven Plugin, standalone command-line tool, Java API, or Eclipse Plug-in.

You might have a look at an <<code/com.altran.general.emf.ecoredoc.maven/src/test/resources/testGeneratorConfig/expected.adoc#, example rendering>>
(suffering from GitLab rendering issues, full-fledged AsciiDoctor output looks better).

For more details, please refer to the <<doc/ecoredoc-userguide.adoc#, EcoreDoc User Guide>>.

However, the GitLab rendering misses important parts,
so you might want to look at the link:doc/ecoredoc-userguide.pdf[PDF version] with different rendering issues,
or clone the repository and use the link:doc/ecoredoc-userguide.html[official rendering].
